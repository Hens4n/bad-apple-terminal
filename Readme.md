## About the project
It's just a personal project to play "Bad Apple!!" on the terminal using ASCII character. Possibly it will can be used to reproduce other things in the terminal in ASCII characters, but my goal now is to play "Bad Apple!!".

This project is also a challenge to myself to put all my knowledge and creativity into action.

## What is Bad Apple?
Briefly, "Bad Apple!!" is a popular Japanese song from the Touhou game series which got famous by the variety of places (like a [calculator](https://youtu.be/6pAeWf3NPNU)) to play the [2009 fan-released 3D clip](https://youtu.be/UkgK8eUdpAo) of this song. 

## Still in progress
I will soon update the Readme with some information about the code.
